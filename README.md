### Pitch: 
In 2026, fake news has become rampant; from AI generated propaganda to misinformation spread on social media. It becomes increasingly important to have tools that can distinguish between real news and fake news. This is the basis of our project. We aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a news title and blurb are fake or real, using a Kaggle dataset. 

### Milestones:
Load the Data 
Explore the dataset
Preprocess the data
Load a BERT model
Train the model, fine-tuning BERT
Generate submission
Create presentation

### Technologies Used
* Pytorch
* Jupyter notebook
* Python
* Pandas/NumPy/MatPlotLib
* Github
* Scikit learn
* BERT

### Next Steps
Test on a different dataset (not on Kaggle) by extracting data through webscraping

### Interesting stories from development
#### Git Issues
* Merge conflicts - we resolved them by using Github’s merge tool and also resetting when changes weren’t pertinent.
* Creating and switching between branches
#### Code Issues
* Lots of compatibility issues - we were basing our workflow off of an outdated notebook
* We didn’t have a lot of prior experience
#### Tips
* Be flexible
* Familiarize yourself with Scikit learn and the theory behind NLP first

### Dataset
